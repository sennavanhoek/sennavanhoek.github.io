# ~$ whoami
A Dutch cyber security student with a keen interest in what makes things tick, be it (micro)architectural or biological.  
When I'm not practicing Jodo, Iaido or (a bit of) Kendo at [our local dojo](https://www.kendokai-higashi.nl/), I mostly work on small electronics and software projects like you will find on this blog.
